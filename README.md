# bikeshare_project
This is a user interactive Udacity project from Data Science Nanodegree program for bikesahredata from CHicago, NYC, and DC
Here we deal with the following data set:

-Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following additional Gender and Birth Year info.

#The statistics computed here are: popular times of travel (month, week, hour), popular stations and trip, trip duration and user info.
